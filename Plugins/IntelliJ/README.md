<!-- Plugin description -->
Expand your test coverage by including the View layer. Testify allows you to easily set up a variety of screenshot tests in your application. Capturing a screenshot of your view gives you a new tool for monitoring the quality of your UI experience. It's also an easy way to review changes to your UI. Once you've established a comprehensive set of screenshots for your application, you can use them as a "visual dictionary". In this case, a picture really is worth a thousand words; it's easy to catch unintended changes in your view rendering by watching for differences in your captured images.

This plugin will enhance the developer experience by adding fully integrated IDE UI for all relevant Testify commands.

- Run the Testify screenshot tests
- Record a new baseline image
- Pull screenshots from the device and into your project
- Remove any existing screenshot test images from the device
- Reveal the baseline image in Android Studio
- Delete the baseline image from your project
