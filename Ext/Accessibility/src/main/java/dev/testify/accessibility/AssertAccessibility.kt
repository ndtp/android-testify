/**
 * To help people with disabilities access Android apps, developers of those apps need to consider how their apps will
 * be presented to accessibility services. Some good practices can be checked by automated tools, such as if a View has
 * a contentDescription. Other rules require human judgment, such as whether or not a contentDescription makes sense to
 * all users.
 *
 * Enabling [assertAccessibility] on [ScreenshotRule] will run the latest set of checks as defined by the Accessibility
 * Test Framework for Android (https://github.com/google/Accessibility-Test-Framework-for-Android). This library
 * collects various accessibility-related checks on [View] objects as well as AccessibilityNodeInfo objects (which the
 * Android framework derives from Views and sends to AccessibilityServices).
 *
 * @see https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/accessibility-checking
 *
 * All elements within the hierarchy defined by [android.R.id.content] will be available to the check.
 *
 * @throws [AccessibilityErrorsException] - Errors have been found in the hierarchy.
 * @throws [MalformedBaselineException] - The baseline json file is corrupt or cannot be loaded.
