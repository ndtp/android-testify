# Testify — Android Screenshot Testing — Fullscreen capture method

<a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/dev.testify/testify-fullscreen"><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.testify/testify-fullscreen?color=%236e40ed&label=dev.testify%3Atestify-fullscreen"/></a>

**Capture the entire device screen, including system UI, dialogs and menus.**

Use the [UiAutomator's](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/other-components/ui-automator) built-in [screenshotting](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/uiautomator/UiDevice#takescreenshot) capability to capture a [Bitmap](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap) of the entire device.

The bitmap will be generated from a PNG at 1:1 scale and 100% quality. The bitmap's size will match the full device resolution and include all system UI such as the status bar and navigation bar.

As the system UI content is highly variable, you can use [ScreenshotRule.excludeStatusBar](./src/main/java/dev/testify/capture/fullscreen/provider/StatusBarExclusionRectProvider.kt) and/or [ScreenshotRule.excludeNavigationBar](./src/main/java/dev/testify/capture/fullscreen/provider/NavigationBarExclusionRectProvider.kt) to ignore the status bar and navigation bar, respectively.

Though the PNG is intended to be lossless, some compression artifacts or GPU-related variance can occur. As such, it is recommended to use a small tolerance when capturing fullscreen images.

You can set a comparison tolerance using [ScreenshotRule.setExactness](../../Library/src/main/java/dev/testify/ScreenshotRule.kt).

# Set up testify-fullscreen

**Root build.gradle**

```groovy
plugins {
    id("dev.testify") version "3.1.0" apply false
}
```

**settings.gradle**

Ensure that `mavenCentral()` is available to both `pluginManagement` and `dependencyResolutionManagement`.

**Application build.gradle**
```groovy
dependencies {
    androidTestImplementation "dev.testify:testify-fullscreen:2.0.0"
}
```

# Write a test

In order to capture the full device screen, you must set the capture method on `ScreenshotRule` to `fullscreenCapture()`.
You can do this with either `setCaptureMethod(::fullscreenCapture)` or the helper extension method `captureFullscreen()`.

Additonal examples can be found in [FullscreenCaptureExampleTest.kt](../../Samples/Legacy/src/androidTest/java/dev/testify/sample/FullscreenCaptureExampleTests.kt).

```kotlin
class FullscreenCaptureTest {

    @get:Rule
    var rule = ScreenshotRule(MainActivity::class.java)

    @ScreenshotInstrumentation
    @Test
    fun fullscreen() {
        rule
            .captureFullscreen()    // Set the fullscreen capture method
            .excludeSystemUi()      // Exclude the navigation bar and status bar areas from the comparison
            .setExactness(0.95f)    // Allow a 5% variation in color
            .assertSame()
    }
}

```
