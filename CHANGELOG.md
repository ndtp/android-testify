### Library

#### Changed

- Internal file management is now abstracted through the new `Destination` interface.
  This interface allows for extensibility and customization of the file handling. It is backwards
  compatible with
  the existing SDCard and app data/data directory options.

#### Bug fixes

- Fix https://github.com/ndtp/android-testify/issues/81: `reportShow` and `reportPull` now support
  Gradle 7+.
- Exceptions now correctly report the gradle module name of the source of the error.

#### Added

- Reporter now supports skipped or ignored tests.
- Added `enableReporter` parameter to `ComposableScreenshotRule` constructor

### Sample

- FlixSample now using Espresso IdlingResource to eliminate screenshot test race condition.

#### Changed

- `Sample` has been renamed to `LegacySample` and moved to the `Samples/Legacy` directory.

### Gradle Plugin

#### Added

- Add multi-user support to the Gradle Plugin.
- Use `-Puser=<number>` to override the default user.
- Added unit tests to the `:Plugin` project.

### Compose Extension

- Fixed #120 - can set a custom capture method when using ComposableScreenshotRule

---

## 2.0.0-beta01

### Library

#### Added

- `@IgnoreScreenshot` annotation added
    - An annotation used to ignore screenshots tests. Test will be reported as Skipped.
    - Should be used as a more versatile replacement for the `orientationToIgnore` argument
      on `@ScreenshotInstrumentation`
- `ScreenshotRule.assertSame()` will now throw an `UnexpectedDeviceException` if a baseline exists
  with a different device description than that of the currently running device.
  This can be helpful to catch cases where you may be running a test against the wrong emulator. You
  can add add `-Pdevice=N` to any Testify Gradle command to target a specific device.

#### Removed

- `orientationToIgnore` argument on `@ScreenshotInstrumentation` has been removed
    - Use `@IgnoreScreenshot` instead

#### Changed

- Library tests now use mockk.
- Class `DeviceIdentifier.DeviceStringFormatter` has been migrated to a top-level
  class, `DeviceStringFormatter`
- `DeviceIdentifier.getDeviceDimensions` has been replaced
  by `fun getDeviceDimensions(context: Context): Pair<Int, Int>`
- `DeviceIdentifier.getDescription` has been replaced
  by `fun getDeviceDescription(context: Context): String`
- `DeviceIdentifier.formatDeviceString` has been replaced
  by `fun formatDeviceString(formatter: DeviceStringFormatter, format: String): String`
- `OutputFileUtility.doesOutputFileExist` has been replaced
  by `fun doesOutputFileExist(context: Context, filename: String): Boolean`
- `OutputFileUtility.getFileRelativeToRoot` has been replaced
  by `fun getFileRelativeToRoot(subpath: String, fileName: String, extension: String): String`
- `OutputFileUtility.getOutputDirectoryPath` has been replaced
  by `fun getOutputDirectoryPath(context: Context): File`
- `OutputFileUtility.getOutputFilePath` has been replaced
  by `fun getOutputFilePath(context: Context, fileName: String, extension: String = PNG_EXTENSION): String`
- `OutputFileUtility.getPathRelativeToRoot` has been replaced
  by `fun getPathRelativeToRoot(subpath: String): String`
- `OutputFileUtility.useSdCard` has been replaced by `fun useSdCard(arguments: Bundle): Boolean`
- `ScreenshotUtility.assureScreenshotDirectory` has been replaced
  by `fun assureScreenshotDirectory(context: Context): Boolean`
- `ScreenshotUtility.createBitmapFromActivity` has been replaced
  by `fun createBitmapFromActivity(activity: Activity, fileName: String, captureMethod: CaptureMethod, screenshotView: View? = activity.window.decorView): Bitmap?`
- `ScreenshotUtility.loadBaselineBitmapForComparison` has been replaced
  by `fun loadBaselineBitmapForComparison(context: Context, testName: String): Bitmap?`
- `ScreenshotUtility.loadBitmapFromAsset` has been replaced
  by `fun loadBitmapFromAsset(context: Context, filePath: String): Bitmap?`
- `ScreenshotUtility.loadBitmapFromFile` has been replaced
  by `fun loadBitmapFromFile(outputPath: String, preferredBitmapOptions: BitmapFactory.Options): Bitmap?`
- `ScreenshotUtility.preferredBitmapOptions` has been replaced
  by `val preferredBitmapOptions: BitmapFactory.Options`
- `ScreenshotUtility.saveBitmapToFile` has been replaced
  by `fun saveBitmapToFile(context: Context, bitmap: Bitmap?, outputFilePath: String): Boolean`

### Plugin

#### Changed

- Added `screenshotAnnotation` setting to the Testify gradle extension, allowing customization of
  the instrumentation annotation used to identify screenshot tests. This makes the
  @ScreenshotInstrumentation annotation optional.

#### Removed

- Removed `verifyImageMagick` and `removeDiffImages` tasks

### All Projects

#### Updates

- kotlin to 1.7.21
- kotlin-gradle-plugin to 1.7.21
- kotlinx-coroutines-android to 1.6.4
- kotlin-stdlib-jdk8 to 1.7.21
- Android Gradle Plugin to 7.3.1

### Accessibility Checks Extension Library

Combine visual regression testing with accessibility checks to further improve the quality and
expand the reach of your application.

---

## 2.0.0-alpha02

### Compose Extension Library

#### Changed

- `ComposableScreenshotRule` now has an additional constructor argument, `composeTestRule`. This
  provides you with a default instance of `ComposeTestRule` or allows you to provide your own
  instance. With this `composeTestRule` instance, you can now use the `ComposeTestRule` semantics to
  interact with the UI hierarchy prior to taking screenshots.

  ```kotlin
    @get:Rule
    val rule = ComposableScreenshotRule(composeTestRule = createAndroidComposeRule(ComposableTestActivity::class.java))
    @ScreenshotInstrumentation
    @Test
    fun default() {
        rule
            .setCompose {
                var text by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
                TextField(
                    value = text,
                    onValueChange = { text = it },
                    modifier = Modifier.testTag("field")
                )
            }
            .setComposeActions { composeTestRule ->
                composeTestRule.onNodeWithTag("field").performTextInput("testify")
            }
            .assertSame()
    }
  ```

#### Added

- `ComposableTestActivity` now supports resource wrapping. This means that Testify can configure the
  font scale and locale for tests. Compose screenshot tests will now respect the `locale`
  and `fontScale` configuration parameters. Usage:
  ```kotlin
  rule
      .setCompose {
          Text("Example")
      }
      .setLocale(Locale.FRANCE)
      .setFontScale(2.0f)
  ```

## Unreleased

### Fullscreen Extension Library

Capture the entire device screen, including system UI, dialogs and menus.

### Accessibility Checks Extension Library

Combine visual regression testing with accessibility checks to further improve the quality and
expand the reach of your application.

---

## 2.0.0-alpha01

:warning: Major breaking changes.

This version is provided as an easier migration path to the Testify 2.0 libraries.
2.0.0-alpha01 is functionally identical to 1.2.0-alpha01 but all classes have been updated to use
the new `dev.testify` namespace.

If you update all of your code to reference `dev.testify` instead of `com.shopify.testify` you will
be better positioned to adopt the new Testify 2.0 API.

Please the the [Migration Guide](https://ndtp.github.io/android-testify/docs/migration)

---

## 1.2.0-alpha01

- Bump Testify core version to 1.2.0-alpha01

### Library

- targetSdkVersion from 29 to 31

---

## 1.1.0

Library and plugin released without additional changes.

## 1.1.0-rc01

### Library

#### Bug fixes

- https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/228
  , https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/215
  Account for uneven processing chunk sizes. As Testify processes, it divides the images into chunks
  for faster, parallel processing.
  A bug in the original code assumed that each processing chunk would be equally sized. This caused
  an out-of-bounds exception in any case where the number of pixels in the image could not be evenly
  divided.

- https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/216
  You can now use `ScreenshotRule.setExactness()` in conjunction
  with `ScreenshotRule.defineExclusionRects()`. You can now define both an exclusion area and an
  exactness threshold.

#### Added

- Method `ScreenshotRule.getExactness():Float?` added.

#### Changes

- Method `ScreenshotRule.setExactness(exactness: Float?): ScreenshotRule<T>` now accepts a nullable
  value.
- `TestifyFeatures.GenerateDiffs` now visualizes exclusion regions and the exactness tolerance.
  When enabled, GenerateDiffs will write a companion image for your screenshot test which can help
  you more easily
  identify which areas of your test have triggered the screenshot failure.
  Diff files are only generated for failing tests.
  The generated file will be created in the same directory as your baseline images. Diff files can
  be pulled from
  the device using `:screenshotPull`.

    - Black pixels are identical between the baseline and test image
    - Grey pixels have been excluded from the comparison
    - Yellow pixels are different, but within the Exactness threshold
    - Red pixels are different
- Method `DeviceIdentifier.getDeviceDimensions(context: Context): Pair<Int, Int>` is now public.

---

## 1.1.0-beta3

### Library

### Gradle Plugin

#### Bug fixes

- Several internal changes to support Gradle 7.
- Fix https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/225
  Apply annotations to task properties for up-to-date checks. Adds missing annotations on public
  properties in Tasks to assist with up-to-date checks. Missing annotations are now errors in Gradle
  7.0+.
- Fix https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/234
  Using the Testify plugin with AGP 7+ would generate the error "Cannot query the value of
  property 'applicationId' because configuration of project ':app' has not completed yet". Fixed by
  catching the error and providing a sensible default. In the case where the test packaged ID is
  incorrectly inferred, the user can specify `testify { testPackageId "my.custom.package.test" }` in
  their build.gradle to override the inferred value.

### Library

#### Changes

- Renamed the `rootViewId` setter on `ScreenshotTestRule` for better Java interoperability. It has
  been renamed to `setRootViewIdResource`.

---

## 1.1.0-beta2

### Library

#### Bug fixes

- Fix "ParallelPixelProcessor.kt:90 - java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: index=315250 out of
  bounds (limit=315250)"
  https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/215

#### Updates

- AGP from 4.2.0-beta6 to 4.2.0

### Sample

#### Changes

- Remove kotlin-android-extensions from Sample and replace with viewBinding

## 1.1.0-beta1

### Library

#### Changes

- Optional constructor argument enableReporter added to ScreenshotRule. Allows you to specify
  whether to run the reporter for this test rule.
- TestifyFeatures now support multiple named strings.
- PixelCopyCapture can be enabled using either "testify-experimental-capture" or "
  testify-pixelcopy-capture" in the AndroidManifest
- FuzzyCompare (setExactness) is now multi-threaded and significantly faster.
- ScreenshotRule constructor argument activityClass is now `protected`
- ScreenshotRule constructor argument rootViewId is now `protected`
- ScreenshotRule constructor argument launchActivity is now `protected`
- ScreenshotRule.testNameComponents is now `public`
- ScreenshotRule.fullyQualifiedTestPath is now `public`
- ScreenshotRule.getRootView is now `public`
- ScreenshotRule.instrumentationPrintln is now `public`
- ScreenshotRule.isRecordMode is now `public`

- ScreenshotRule.beforeActivityLaunched() is now annotated with `@CallSuper`
- ScreenshotRule.afterActivityLaunched() is now annotated with `@CallSuper`

#### Added

- Added `TestifyFeatures.GenerateDiffs`. When enabled, will output a `.diff.png` alongside existing
  baseline images. These images are high-contrast images where each difference, regardless of how
  minor, are indicated in red against a black background. See the `generateDiffs` test
  in `ScreenshotRuleExampleTests` for an example. Diff images will be pulled from the device when
  running `screenshotPull`.
- ScreenshotRule now supports the generation of YAML test reports.
- Added `Reporter` feature flag to TestifyFeatures. Allows you to enable test reporting.
- Added method `ScreenshotRule.beforeAssertSame()`. This method is invoked immediately before
  assertSame and before the activity is launched.
- Added method `ScreenshotRule.beforeInitializeView(activity: Activity)`. This method is invoked
  prior to any view modifications and prior to layout inflation.
- Added method `ScreenshotRule.afterInitializeView(activity: Activity)`. This method is invoked
  after layout inflation and all view modifications have been applied.
- Added method `ScreenshotRule.beforeScreenshot(activity: Activity)`. This method is invoked
  immediately before the screenshot is taken.
- Added method `ScreenshotRule.afterScreenshot(activity: Activity, currentBitmap: Bitmap?)`. This
  method is invoked immediately after the screenshot has been taken.
- Added method `ScreenshotRule.applyViewModifications(parentView: ViewGroup)`. This method is called
  on the parent view to make runtime modifications to the view properties or layout.

#### Updates:

- Compile and Target SDK from 29 to 30
- AGP from 4.1.0 to 4.2.0-beta6
- Gradle from 6.5 to 6.7.1
- Kotlin from 1.3.72 to 1.4.31
- AppCompat from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0
- Espresso from 3.2.0 to 3.3.0

- Test Runner from 1.1.1 to 1.3.0

### Gradle Plugin

#### Added

- Added task `reportShow` to print the test result report to the console.
- Added task `reportPull` to copy the report file from the device and wait for it to be committed to
  disk.

### Sample

#### Updates:

- Material from 1.1.0 to 1.3.0
- MockitoKotlin from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0

---

## 1.0.0-rc3

### Library

#### Changes

- ScreenshotUtility is now public
- ScreenshotBaselineNotDefinedException now reports the expected device key

#### Added

- Public method getRootViewId() has been added to ScreenshotRule

## 1.0.0-rc2

### Library

#### Bug fixes

- Increase the timeout values on orientation change. Addresses
  various `Failed to apply requested rotation` and `Activity did not resume` errors when
  invoking `setOrientation`.

#### Updates

- Android Gradle Plugin to 4.1.0
- Gradle Wrapper to 6.5

### Gradle Plugin

#### Bug fixes

- Access task names lazily via names property. We were previously accessing task names in a way
  which resulted in early configuration of tasks resulting in Gradle failing to sync on the latest
  versions of Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin when custom lint checks were used in a project.
  Likely related to https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/67482030#comment2.
  Use the `TaskContainer.names` which doesn't cause all tasks to be resolved immediately.

### Sample App

- Update Sample application to use a Pixel 3a API 30 baseline emulator.

---

## 1.0.0-rc1

#### Changes

- Replace Travis CI with GitHub Actions. https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/actions

### Library

#### Bug fixes

- Fix https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/138
  Introduce the `setFocusTarget` method on `ScreenshotRule` which allows for keyboard focus to be
  placed on an explicit View.

- Fix https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/165
  Increase the timeout on the ActivityLifecycleMonitor to 5 seconds to allow for the rotation to
  complete.
  Deregister the lifecycle callback.

- Fix https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/issues/166
  Replace the existing FuzzyCompare algorithm with CIEDE2000. Calculate the colour difference value
  between two colours in lab space.
  The CIELAB color space (also known as CIE L* a* b* or sometimes abbreviated as simply "Lab" color
  space) is a color space defined by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1976.
  It expresses color as three values: L* for the lightness from black (0) to white (100), a* from
  green (−) to red (+), and b* from blue (−) to yellow (+).
  CIELAB was designed so that the same amount of numerical change in these values corresponds to
  roughly the same amount of visually perceived change.
  The CIE calls their distance metric ΔE * ab where delta is a Greek letter often used to denote
  difference, and E stands for Empfindung; German for "sensation".
  If deltaE < 1 then the difference can't recognized by human eyes.

### Plugin

#### Changed

- The gradle plugin has moved to `Plugins/Gradle`

---

## 1.0.0-beta5

### Library

#### New

- Add defineExclusionRects method to ScreenshotRule. You can now use defineExclusionRects to exclude
  regions from a bitmap comparison.

### Updates

- Android Gradle Plugin to 4.0.0
- AndroidX Junit to 1.1.1
- AndroidX Test Rules to 1.2.0
- Kotlin to 1.3.72
- Mockito to 3.3.3

---

## 1.0.0-beta4 -- June 17, 2020

### Plugin

#### New

- Added `autoImplementLibrary` member to the `testify` extension. Defaults to `true`.
  When set to `false`, prevents the Plugin from automatically adding a
  Library `androidTestImplementation` dependency to your project.
  This is useful for local debugging or if you require a different version of the library and
  plugin.

### Library

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed issue #153 - Orientation change will now be reliably applied regardless of how many times
  you invoke `setOrientation` in a single test class.

## 1.0.0-beta3 -- June 11, 2020

### Library

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue #151. Plugin correctly displays Locale string with an underscore, not a dash.
  e.g. `en_US`, not `en-US`

## 1.0.0-beta2 -- May 20, 2020

### Library

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue #148. Can now correctly override both enabled and disabled features using an
  AndroidManifest meta-data tag.

## 1.0.0-beta1 -- May 2, 2020

Breaking changes introduced. Bumped Testify to 1.0.0-beta1

### Library

#### New

- :warning: Screenshot images now are written to subdirectories under the `screenshot` directory on
  device. Screenshot paths on device now include the full device key and such are properly defined
  to fully represent the device configuration used to generate the images.
  This can be a breaking change if you use custom scripting to pull/access screenshot images from
  the emulator.
- :warning: The emulator locale is now encoded into the device key by default. Previously, only the
  language was encoded in the key. You can disable this behavior using
  the `Locale` (`testify-experimental-locale`) feature.
  This change will require you to rename your baseline image directory to include the full locale
  path.
- [TestifyFeatures](https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/blob/7d0833b2cfedf05d4084d048d165d5f6646a8cba/Library/src/main/java/com/shopify/testify/TestifyFeatures.kt)
  Enable or disable some features at runtime via manifest entry or in code.
- [ScreenshotRule.withExperimentalFeatureEnabled](https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/blob/7d0833b2cfedf05d4084d048d165d5f6646a8cba/Library/src/main/java/com/shopify/testify/ScreenshotRule.kt#L211)
  Used in conjunction with `TestifyFeatures`, you can selectively enable an experimental feature on
  the test rule. Features are reset after `assertSame` is called.
- [TestifyLayout](https://github.com/Shopify/android-testify/blob/7d0833b2cfedf05d4084d048d165d5f6646a8cba/Library/src/main/java/com/shopify/testify/annotation/TestifyLayout.kt)
  can now accept a layout resource name or a layout resource ID.
  This is useful for library projects where resource IDs are not stable.
- Two new bitmap capture algorithms have been added. You can now select between PixelCopy, Canvas
  and DrawingCache capture methods.
  These can be enabled with by passing either CanvasCapture or PixelCopyCapture
  to `withExperimentalFeatureEnabled`, or by enabling `testify-canvas-capture`
  or `testify-experimental-capture` in your manifest.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fully support changing locale during testing on API 19+
- Correctly access external files directory on API 28+
- Correctly detect the locale on API 22
- `SoftwareRenderViewModification` now qualifies all views, not just `ImageView`
- setFontScale now works correctly on API 21+

#### Testing changes

- Add `TestActivity` to androidTest configuration of Library for testing
- Update Library baseline test images to support `en_US` locale
- Add tests for `Experimental PixelCopy` API
- Update `DeviceIdentifierTest` to work with locale (not language)
- Add tests for `TestifyFeatures`

#### Updates

- Gradle from 4.10.2 to 6.2.1
- Android Gradle Plugin from 3.3.2 to 3.6.1
- ktlint from 0.29.0 to 0.36.0

- AndroidX AppCompat from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- AndroidX Core Ktx from 1.0.1 to 1.1.0
- AndroidX Test Core from 2.0.0-rc01 to 2.1.0
- AndroidX Test Espresso from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0
- Dokka from 0.9.18 to 0.10.0
- Kotlin from 1.3.21 to 1.3.70
- Mockito2 from 2.23.0 to 2.28.2
- Travis CI now downloads and installs Android SDK 29
- Split Bintray gradle script to separate file
- Kotlin stdlib8 from stdlib7

### Plugin:

#### New

- :warning: **Breaking Change**
  The `testify {}` gradle extension been restructured. Testify no longer requires the `testify`
  extension to be defined in your project.
  This is particularly valuable for Android library projects as Testify can now correctly infer most
  settings automatically.
  Most settings can now be inferred. Testify now supports multiple flavor dimensions and product
  flavors.
    - `testContextId` has been deleted and is no longer needed.
    - `applicationIdSuffix` has been deleted. Its value can now be inferred.
    - `installTask` has been added. You can specify which task to run to install your APK. This is
      automatically inferred, but you may wish to override the default value.
    - `installAndroidTestTask` has been added. You can specify which task to run to install the
      Android Instrumentation test package. This is automatically inferred, but you may wish to
      override the default value.
      You can view the inferred extension values by running `./gradlew testifySettings`
- Added `verbose` logging support. Add `-Pverbose=true` to your gradle commands to enable verbose
  logging. e.g. `./gradlew Sample:screenshotTest -Pverbose=true`
- The device key is now based off the emulator locale, not language. (e.g. `en_US` instead of
  just `en`)
- Testify plugin no longer requires `adb root` access. `screenshotPull` and `screenshotClear` can
  now work on any device or Google Play emulator image.

#### Bug Fixes

- `screenshotClear` will now properly delete files when running from a Windows client.
- Screenshots are now copied to the correct baseline directory when captured on a landscape
  emulator.
- Screenshots are now copied to the correct baseline directory regardless of emulator locale.
- Testify now more accurately detects the appropriate `install` task for your project. Testify
  relies on this to correctly insall your APK for testing and can now infer more project types
  correctly.
- Correctly set and get the locale language and region on API 22.
- Correctly support overridden display density.

#### Testing changes

- JVM tests now log status to console.

#### Updates

- Update to kotlin stdlib8 from stdlib7.

### Sample App:

- Update compile SDK from 28 to 29
- Update target SDK from 28 to 29
- Extend MaterialComponents theme instead of AppCompat theme
- Re-record baseline using locale key
