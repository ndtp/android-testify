 * @param layoutId: This integer parameter is a layout resource reference
 *      (e.g. {@code android.R.layout.list_content}).
 * @param layoutResName: A fully qualified resource name of the form "package:type/entry"
 *      (e.g. {@code android:layout/list_content}).
 *      Unfortunately R fields are not constants in Android library projects. LayoutRes IDs cannot
 *      be used as annotations parameters.
