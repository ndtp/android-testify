/**
 * A [ViewModification] that sets the layer type to [View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE].
 *
 * A software layer is backed by a bitmap and causes the view to be rendered using Android's software rendering pipeline,
 * even if hardware acceleration is enabled.
 *
 * Software layers can occasionally be useful to work around inconsistencies present when using hardware acceleration on
 * a variety of different devices. For example, some devices may render a view differently when hardware acceleration is
 * enabled, so a software layer can be used to ensure that the view is rendered consistently across all devices.
 *
 * However, it is important to note that the software rendered is significantly slower than the hardware accelerated.
 * And, some features (such as rounded corners, shadows and elevation) are not supported when using software rendering.
 * This may result in undesirable artifacts when using software rendering.
 *
 * If you are using a custom view that is not rendering consistently across devices, you may want to consider the
 * techniques described in the
 * [Accounting for platform differences](https://testify.dev/blog/platform-differences) blog post.
